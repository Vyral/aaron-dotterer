Whenever you buy a resale home, build a new home, or sell a home, there’s one key step you’ll need to take: ordering a home inspection. To give you more information about what the home inspection process looks like, as well as why it’s necessary, **I recently met with Derreck Weatherford of 360 Home Inspections.**&nbsp;

According to Derreck, getting a home inspection before buying a resale property is essential. After all, the last thing you want as a new homeowner is to discover after moving in that you need a new roof. Understanding the condition of the property before you commit to a purchase can save you a lot of time, money, and energy in the long run.&nbsp;

Information from a home inspection report can also be used in negotiations with the seller. This allows you, the buyer, to ask the seller to make certain repairs or give you a credit to fix them yourself.&nbsp;

**But what about when you buy a new home?** New properties come with a one-year builder’s warranty designed to protect the homeowner in the event they discover a defect after moving in. Even with this protection in place, however, getting an inspection is still key. After all, a small issue, if left undiscovered, can become a huge problem later on. When you buy new construction, it’s also good to order a second inspection after you’ve moved in about a month or so before your one-year warranty is up. This will give you one last chance to identify and fix any issues that have arisen during your time in the home.&nbsp;

As a final note, Derreck also pointed out the benefits of ordering an inspection before you sell. Pre-listing inspections give sellers the opportunity to identify and resolve issues before buyers ever set foot in their home. Also, being able to provide proof of recent repairs as well as the complete inspection report to a buyer can make them feel much more comfortable about purchasing your home.&nbsp;

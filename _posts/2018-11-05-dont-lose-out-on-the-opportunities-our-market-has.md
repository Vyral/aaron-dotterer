Right now is a prime time to buy in the East Valley, and there are a couple reasons for that:

**1. Interest rates are still historically low.** Even though people think rates are high, in the grand scheme of the market, they’re simply not. We’re sitting at around 5% at the moment, and those rates are scheduled to go up a couple more times in 2019, possibly bringing us up to around 6%. It doesn’t sound like a huge jump, but if you’re buying a $200,000 house, the jump from 5% to 6% could raise your monthly payment by almost $200.

**2. We have access to tons of down payment assistance programs.** If you were waiting to enter the market because you needed to gather up enough for a down payment, you might not need to worry about that since you could qualify for assistance. Through our contacts at the various banks and counties, we can help set up with down payment assistance programs, which are designed to help first-time homebuyers purchase a home with no down payment. They can give you anywhere from 3.5% to 5% of the purchase price to cover your down payment. All you’d have to do is come in and cover the costs of the home inspection, the appraisal, and closing costs.

It’s also a great time to sell in our market because:

**1. Inventory is at an all-time low.** This is a good thing, because with supply and demand, this means that your home is that much more attractive to any buyers in the market, especially when it’s priced right and marketed correctly—both of which are our specialties. We can whip up a bidding war for your home, which not only keeps the market healthy, but it also means you’ll get the most money possible for your home.

**2. The holidays are actually a great time to list your home.** Despite the fact that many people seem to think the holidays are a bad time to sell, this time of year can work very well in a seller’s favor. Inventory is low, since people falsely believe they can’t sell right now, you’ll have less competition for other sellers than if you waited until spring.

If you’re interested in buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help.

With the current state of our market, **those that are looking to downsize are in prime position to do so.** Today Chioki Wade from loanDepot and I will discuss this topic in greater depth.&nbsp;

A number of homeowners have spent the last 15 years or so growing their family and, all the while, building equity in their home. Now, they’re looking to downsize.&nbsp;

Our market is becoming less seller-dominated and is beginning to transition over into a buyer’s market, which works in favor of downsizing buyers.&nbsp;

Let’s turn our attention to interest rates, because it’s good to know where they are currently situated when stepping into the market. Rates are still very favorable when measured against those of the recent past—**with a good credit score, a buyer can lock in a rate between 4.5% and 4.625%. Compared to late 2018 where rates were in the low-5% range, this is incredible.&nbsp;**

**Some buyers are using downsizing as a means to purchase an investment property.** These buyers sell their larger homes, collect the equity, and move into a smaller property, such as a condo, so that they can travel and have less house to be responsible for.&nbsp;

They have a fairly large chunk of change left over from their home sale and aren’t sure what to do with it. **To further build on that equity and generate cash flow, a lot of these folks opt to buy an investment property.** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

This is where Chioki comes in; he currently has two clients that are taking steps to downsize in this manner, so he’s no stranger to these sorts of situations. One of those clients is selling their home in order to downsize and invest in a property for their daughter, who’s a current college student, and some roommates to live in. From a cash flow perspective, the home is paying for itself and it allows the buyer to reinvest their equity.&nbsp;

**Despite the popular belief that you need to put 20% down or more, you can actually get into an investment property with as little as 15% down.&nbsp;**

For any financing questions or for more information on the topics we discussed, you can reach Chioki directly on his cell at 480-684-4031.&nbsp;

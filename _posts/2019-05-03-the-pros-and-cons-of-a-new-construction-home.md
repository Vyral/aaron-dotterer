Is a new construction home right for you? There are a few pros and cons you may want to consider.

**Cons:**

**1\. You have to build it.** It takes six to nine months depending on the builder, how busy they are, and the features you’ve chosen. However, this can also help you decide when to sell your old home and make the move.

**2\. You’re moving into a construction zone.** If your home is part of a new community, chances are it isn’t the last one being built. You’ll have to deal with a lot of construction while other homes are being built.&nbsp;

**3\. It’s a blank canvas.** You’ll have to choose every finish, option, room, interior, and exterior. Backyards usually aren’t included, and you’ll have to have somebody come in and redo it all. You’re looking at paying around $8,000 to $10,000 for this.

**Pros:**

**1\. It’s brand new.** You get to build it, and you get to pick everything you want and customize it. With a resale home, you’re stuck with whatever the previous owner had done to it.

**2\. New homes come with amenities.** In master-planned communities, you’ll often find community pools, playgrounds, country clubs, golf courses, dog parks, running paths, and so on.

**3\. You’ll save money.** If you’re buying a home during the beginning of a new community, you can find a cheaper home. They sell homes for less at the outset and then ramp up the prices as construction goes on. By buying in the beginning, you’ll already have built-in equity at the end.

No matter what you decide to do, you should always have an experienced Realtor at your side. Tell them when you’re looking at model homes so they can help you negotiate. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

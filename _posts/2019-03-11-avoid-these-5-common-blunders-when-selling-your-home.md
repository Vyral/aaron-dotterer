No one wants to sabotage their own home sale. Unfortunately, some sellers unknowingly make mistakes that only hamper their efforts for a successful sale. In today’s message, we’ll consider five common ways this happens.&nbsp;

**1. Bad color schemes.** You and your family might adore the red, neon green, or purple color you painted the kids’ rooms with, but buyers won’t. Before putting your home on the market, cover up those lurid colors with something more neutral, like a tan or lighter gray. You could even make a fun weekend out of it.&nbsp;

**2. Personal taste.** Living here in the Southwest, no one could blame you for having that sort of decor. However, buyers coming from other parts of the country, such as Minnesota or Chicago, to name a few, aren’t going to see it the same way. Pack up some of your Southwestern decor along with personal, family photos. The more you depersonalize, the more buyers will be attracted to the home.&nbsp;

**3. Bad odors.** You’ve probably grown used to the odors that your pet emits, the septic leak outside, or even your neighbor’s compost pile. The problem is these smells won’t evade buyers stepping onto your property for the first time. Some easy, quick fixes to this are getting your carpet professionally cleaned, lighting candles before a showing, and plug-in air fresheners.&nbsp;

**4. Inflexibility with showings.** You, like a lot of other sellers, probably don’t like the idea of having to file out of your home just as you and your family are sitting down to dinner at 6 p.m. because that’s the time that works for the buyer. Think of it this way: That buyer could be the one person that absolutely falls in love with your house. Not knowing what could come of each showing is enough reason to be extremely flexible; plus, flexibility means that more buyers will see your home, which should lead to a quicker sale.&nbsp;

**5. Disguising problem areas.** Items of this nature might include a leaky toilet, a cracked tile, a patch of paint, etc. Covering up the little things without making meaningful fixes could prove to be costly in the end. Buyers will likely catch this and wonder if there are larger issues you’re covering up as well. I advise my clients to have a handyman come in and tackle the last-minute “honey-do-list.”&nbsp;

People give me a lot of reasons as to why they rent a home instead of buying one. **These reasons include:**

* Low credit score
* No money for a down payment
* Fear of a long-term loan payment

Thanks to the opportunities available in today’s market, I’m able to show these renters how they can get around these roadblocks and become homeowners. FHA loans for first-time homebuyers lower the need for a high credit score, allowing applicants to be approved with scores as low as 640.

In Maricopa and Pinal Counties, we have many down payment assistance programs available for potential homebuyers. **These programs will actually give you the money to cover your down payment**; all you’ll need to pay for is the inspection, appraisal, and closing costs (which I can also help you get covered).

People are concerned about the burden of the long-term financial obligation that comes with paying off a mortgage. I tell them this: If you’re renting and paying $1,000 each month, you’re just paying your landlord’s mortgage; wouldn’t you rather be paying your own mortgage instead and build equity as well? After doing this month after month, your principal slowly decreases while your home value increases. **Historically, home values appreciate by about 3% to 4% each year.** You’re looking at a home value increase of 4% to 5% a year while you’re paying down your loan. That’s $8,000 to $10,000 a year on a $200,000 home.

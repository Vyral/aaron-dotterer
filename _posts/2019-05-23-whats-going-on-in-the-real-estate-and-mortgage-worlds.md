Chioki Wade of Loan Depot is with me today to give you all a market update for May. We’ll be going over the number of homes sold, the median price of those homes, and more. Let’s dive right in.

Last month, our active listings were at 17,153. **This signifies a 6.1% drop from the month before. This means that our supply is getting lower and demand is getting higher.** As of right now, we’re still in a buyer’s market. However, if this trend continues, we’ll be on our way to a seller’s market.&nbsp;

Right now is a great time to buy. Part of that reason is that our average price has increased by 1.5% to $270,000 over just the last month. If you’ve been waiting to buy, now is the time to get in before the trend continues.

When we break down the average sale price to the average price per square foot, we’ll see that homes cost $171.80 per sq. ft. on average. **This number can help you get a better idea of what a home’s price should be in the market.**

That’s what we’ve got going on in the housing market, but what’s happening with interest rates? According to Chioki, the good news is that while our average home price remains low, there are also great down payment assistance programs available to help buyers get into a home with little to nothing out of pocket.&nbsp;

Interest rates are almost a full percentage point lower than what they were at this time last year and currently are between 4.125% and 4.25%. **This is more great news for potential buyers because these lower rates increase their affordability.**

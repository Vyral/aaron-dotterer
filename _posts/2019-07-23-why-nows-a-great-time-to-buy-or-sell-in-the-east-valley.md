We’re in an interesting time here in the East Valley market. **Not only is it a great time to sell, but it’s also a great time to buy.&nbsp;**

There are a couple reasons why it’s a great time to sell. First of all, the number of listings being sold is up compared to this time last year. However, the number of total homes on the market is down. In other words, demand is up and supply is down. Specifically, our months' supply of homes, or how many months it would take to sell off all remaining inventory if no new homes came on the market, is just 1.06 months. This is incredibly low.&nbsp;

To put that into perspective, a balanced market has around four months of inventory—anything above that is considered a buyer’s market (i.e., there’s more supply than demand). Because we have just 1.06 months’ worth of inventory, **any home below $500,000 that’s priced right and marketed well will fly off the shelves.&nbsp;**

So why is it also a great time to buy? **One reason: interest rates.** Interest rates are hovering around 4%, which is close to the all-time low of 3.5% we saw a few years ago. So even though prices have been rising, this increases your buying power. Rates are projected to dip down for another month or so before climbing back upward, so the time to take advantage of them is now.&nbsp;

Buyers always ask me why they need to get pre-qualified. Many homebuyers are eager to start browsing homes—they believe that getting pre-qualified can wait. But, to tell the truth, it can’t.

**Getting pre-qualified gives buyers a clear understanding of what kind of home they can afford.** Not only will this help guide your home search, it will also prevent you from setting your sights on something outside of your budget. There’s nothing more disappointing than finding the perfect home only to realize that you can’t afford it. This is why it’s so essential to get pre-qualified before you start looking around.&nbsp;

In addition to showing you what you can afford, a pre-qualification will also help you understand what your monthly payments could look like.&nbsp;

Also, first-time buyers aren’t the only ones who must get pre-qualified. Current homeowners looking to make a move will need to go through the pre-qualification process again to account for current interest rates.&nbsp;

Pre-qualifications aren’t just for the buyer’s benefit, though. They also benefit the seller. **Many sellers won’t even consider an offer from a buyer who isn’t pre-qualified.&nbsp;**

So, now that we’ve explained the importance of getting pre-qualified, you’re probably wondering how it’s done.

**All it takes is a 10- to 15-minute phone call with a lender.** This lender will pull your credit, ask qualifying questions about your income and employment status. They will also ask you to provide relevant personal information, like your date of birth and social security number. After this conversation, a quality lender will be able to share the results of your pre-qualification within an hour. All in all, getting pre-qualified is one of the biggest favors you can do yourself as a buyer.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

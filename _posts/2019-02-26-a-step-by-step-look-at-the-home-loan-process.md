Are you buying a house in 2019? Chioki Wade from Loan Depot joined me recently to talk about exactly what you need to know if the answer is “yes.”

**The first and most important step is to get pre-approved.** Knowing your buying power and matching that up with the price point you’re looking at is a crucial step. It will also allow you to shop for homes with confidence because you’ll know what you can afford.

Your credit score, your income, and interest rates all determine how much you’re going to be able to afford. One of the things people like to focus on is the purchase price, but we think it should be more about what your monthly payment is. That monthly payment is mainly determined by the interest rate, as well as the home’s price.&nbsp;

Rates have been fluctuating a lot lately, especially with the government shutdown. Chioko has seen a substantial improvement lately with the dip in the stock market. It has lowered rates from where they were before, but they may go up again soon. Right now with a decent credit score, rates are in the 4% to 5% range, which is very low, historically speaking.

**In order to get pre-approved, you need at least a 520 credit score.** The higher the score, the more buying power you have and the better rate you can get. Even if you don’t think your credit is up to par, you still have the opportunity to buy a home with certain loan programs.&nbsp;

One of the great things that Chioki and his team offers for free to their clients is credit repair services. They will help you get where you need to be in order to qualify for the loan program you want.

As far as a down payment goes, the range can vary. If you're a veteran and have a VA loan or buy in the country with a USDA loan, you don’t have to have a down payment at all. If you’re looking in a city or here in the valley, you can get a down payment as low as 3% if you haven’t owned a home in the last three years. That can range all the way up to 5%, 10%, or 20%.

If you need down payment assistance, you don’t have to be a first-time buyer. You can get a grant to help you pay for your down payment and you won’t have to pay any of it back.

**From start to finish, the loan process will take about 45 to 90 days, depending on how long your home search takes.**

As we wrap up 2018, we’d like to take a moment and wish you a **merry Christmas, happy holidays, and a happy new year.** This season is all about sharing time with loved ones, and Chioki Wade of loanDepot and I talked about some of our favorite holiday traditions.

One thing I do with my family is bake and decorate sugar cookies together on Christmas Eve. Chioki’s making new traditions each year with his wife and two little boys—making waffles, wearing Christmas pajamas, and decorating together are just a few things they look forward to.

**We hope you enjoy celebrating your traditions this holiday season and create new memories with friends, family, and loved ones.** See you next year!
